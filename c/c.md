## Messed up names?
 According to research, the countries 'Greenland' and 'Iceland' have pretty messed up names, in fact they should be switched around. A researcher of the team 'ACT-1' says, "Well, actually, Greenland used to be green, but due to weather, Greenland was snowed, a lot. And - uh- I don't know about iceland, I think that people who settled there are lonely- I NEED FRIENDSSSSSSSSS" studies later show that the scientist was high on water.

And now the neighborhood is in Anarchy. After 3 years, the econemy of the country collapsed. Scientists bought the broken Nokia for $9000 dollars,and studied it for 6 months.
