# DAY 2:

### 9:22

Sorry for journal-ing late, I felt sick in the early morning, so I decided not to journal.
I had a heavy fever and I a terrible sore throat at 4:33, and in all honesty, felt too tired.

Basically, I went to a buffet and after eating and walking around a bit, and I feel much better now.
The only thing that hurts is my throat right now, but it's not even that bad.
Hopefully, I'll be able to travel and go sightseeing. Or at least go outside. That might make me even more sick, though, so I'll still try to avoid it if I can.

One thing about me is that a new car smell smells like the worst crap anyone could take.
Going to try to avoid our rental car from now on.
