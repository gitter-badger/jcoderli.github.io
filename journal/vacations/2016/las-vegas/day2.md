# DAY 2:

### 9:22

Sorry for journal-ing late, I felt sick in the early morning, so I decided not to journal.
I had a heavy fever and I a terrible sore throat at 4:33, and in all honesty, felt too tired.

Basically, I went to a buffet and after eating and walking around a bit, and I feel much better now.
The only thing that hurts is my throat right now, but it's not even that bad.
Hopefully, I'll be able to travel and go sightseeing. Or at least go outside. That might make me even more sick, though, so I'll still try to avoid it if I can.

One thing about me is that a new car smell smells like the worst crap anyone could take.
Going to try to avoid our rental car from now on.

### 21:34

I didn't get much time to write about anything, so I'm going to fill you in.

After the buffet, we, ugh, _drove_ to Hoover Dam. The moment we got to the bridge that overlooks Hoover Dam, I got blasted with the worst wind. I've been to Chicago, and I think that wind speed was just the same as the wind in Hoover Dam.

To be honest, that's probably why my throat is still on fire.

After eating and exploring more of the Hoover Dam, we finally went back to the hotel.
1 hour of sleeping later, all of us went out to see "Times Square" in "New York, New York".
Las Vegas is known for it's imitations and its big hotels.

When we went outside, I felt fine, but my throat burned. After about 2-3 hours of walking, I could barely stand and was miserable. While I could talk, the cold air and the unmistakable odor of cigarettes filled my lungs, so I barely complained.

Back at the hotel room, I dropped dead and fell asleep.
