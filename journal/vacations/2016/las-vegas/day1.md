# DAY 1:
### 13:27

Well, it seems like it's going to be a while. Right now, we're driving to pick up mom. *yawn*
Nothing interesting so far. Dad's starting to lose some memory. I mean, he remembered to get our passport, but doesn't remember whether he closed the garage door. Hopefully, he did.

During the wait, I sorted out some files. It's really confusing. I wish I knew a better way, but honestly, with the way that it's turning out, I think it's fine. I don't know though. If I do learn some organization skills, I'll make a newer section and call the format I have right now, Going to do more organizing now.

I started on a sitemap. Hopefully it turns out well? It's bright and sunny and we just took an hour drive to DOWNTOWN CINCI. It's really bright down? up? here and so I'm feeling a little happeh.

### 13:52

The water is running out. The food supply is diminishing. Help.
Just kidding ;). But, in all honesty, it's getting very boring in here. I might listen to some P!ATD, but even then I'll still be bored. I did bring soe trinkets, but that won't really help me that much. We picked up mom and now we're going on a highway. It's so hot outside, I'm pretty sure I'm going to get a tan on the left side of my face. As a joke, if I'm going to get tanned, cut out a piece of paper that reads "Help" and it'll leave my skin unburnt and it'll read help. We're parking now at a lot. In the mornings, it's usually freezing, but in the afternoon, whoo, hot af. And it's even late December!

The sitemap is done now!

### 14:49

Right now, I'm at the airport and met up with some friends. I think we'll board soon- Scratch that, one hour until we board. -.-
*sigh*
This is going to be a while of waiting.
Meh, I guess it's better than 2 hours??

### 15:30

Time flies! It seems like it was only 35 minutes. Maybe it was :Ooooo

So, Delta airlines has announced the normal safety procedures and one of them was that Samsung Note 7's are strictly banned.
Just *HAD* to state that :P
