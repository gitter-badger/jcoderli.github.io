# DAY 1:

### 13:27

Well, it seems like it's going to be a while. Right now, we're driving to pick up mom. *yawn*
Nothing interesting so far. Dad's starting to lose some memory. I mean, he remembered to get our passport, but doesn't remember whether he closed the garage door. Hopefully, he did.

During the wait, I sorted out some files. It's really confusing. I wish I knew a better way, but honestly, with the way that it's turning out, I think it's fine. I don't know though. If I do learn some organization skills, I'll make a newer section and call the format I have right now, Going to do more organizing now.

I started on a sitemap. Hopefully it turns out well? It's bright and sunny and we just took an hour drive to DOWNTOWN CINCI. It's really bright down? up? here and so I'm feeling a little happeh.

### 13:52

The water is running out. The food supply is diminishing. Help.
Just kidding ;). But, in all honesty, it's getting very boring in here. I might listen to some P!ATD, but even then I'll still be bored. I did bring some trinkets, but that won't really help me that much. We picked up mom and now we're going on a highway. It's so hot outside, I'm pretty sure I'm going to get a tan on the left side of my face. As a joke, if I'm going to get tanned, cut out a piece of paper that reads "Help" and it'll leave my skin unburnt and it'll read help. We're parking now at a lot. In the mornings, it's usually freezing, but in the afternoon, whoo, hot af. And it's even late December!

The sitemap is done now!

### 14:49

Right now, I'm at the airport and met up with some friends. I think we'll board soon- Scratch that, one hour until we board. -.-
*sigh*
This is going to be a while of waiting.
Meh, I guess it's better than 2 hours??

### 15:30

Time flies! It seems like it was only 35 minutes. Maybe it was :Ooooo

So, Delta airlines has announced the normal safety procedures and one of them was that Samsung Note 7's are strictly banned.
Just *HAD* to state that :P

### 16:22

Delta decided to cancel it until now, but I guess the boarding has officially started! The problem is that they call all the, ew, premium people first.

### 17:24

After a wait of a million years, we were finally allowed to open our computers. Although I can still type this out, it's pretty obvious that I don't have Wifi. There's really nothing to talk about, just that I'm in an airplane. It *says* I have wifi, but I clearly don't, as "loading" a page doesn't do CRAP

There's really no fun in **journal-ing** a page and not being able to load it to see if the heading is actually a heading not just a hashtag. I don't really know what to do. Atom is still fun no matter what, though!

### 18:57

It's been quite a bit of time. The food cart went aroud. I'm kinda tired *yawn*.
Man, I wish I could sleep but SChem-
Darn.
I just spilled some water on my shirt. That's never good. It's a cold - well, moderate airplane.

Looking to my right, I see so many people lined up to use the bathroom. Or whatever they're doing.
Whatever they're doing, it takes a while for them. Only if there was a bigger restroom so everybody can poop and then leave.

In Las Vegas!

### 17:21

Don't be fooled by the time, this _isn't_ tomorrow. I just want to say that I am IN LAS VEGAS! I might update at the hotel, but otherwise, just expect one more update!

### 20:51

Now at the hotel. It's really big. Las Vegas is basically known for the hotels they have. Well, I mean, it's fine, but I mean... the casinos. They smell. Not a good smell (I don't know why you would think that). They _REEK_ of cigarettes, alchohol and long dreary nights of losing money. That's just _one_ of the reasons I stay away from casinos.

There is this one hotel that's a huge pyramid with lights and it just... it's very... extravagant... It's interesting to say the least.

Well, the time is clearly different than in Ohio, so I'm seriously feeling the jetlag over here.

Feeling... kinda... tired... *. *
