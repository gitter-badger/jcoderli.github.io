# DAY 3

### 10:59

I went to the buffet once again. I didn't have much have of an appetite, so it was pretty much $30 wasted, but that's fine, I guess.

We plan on going to the Coca-Cola building, the Hershey's building and the M & M building.

### 12:47

I planned on going to the Coke building first, but the rest of the group decided to go to the M & M building.
Guess I'm stuck with that.

### 13:05

We went to the M & M building and only really watched a short film. It was basically just comedy.

### 13:20

While at the Coca-Cola building, we tasted all types of soda by Coca-Cola from different countries. There was this one _terrible_ soda called "Beverly" and it was... disgusting to say the least.

I mixed all of the leftover drinks and took a sip...
and spit it all back in.

### 18:41

We never actually ended up going to the Hershey's factory. In exchange for that, we went to Caesar's Palace. It was fine and I ended up getting a trinket.

Right now, my nose is stuffy and I really need to blow it ;-;.
