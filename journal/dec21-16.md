# Hello to EVERYBODY reading, from OHIO!
I know this may not be the most interesting of posts, but I plan on bringing my Chromebook with me, so I can "blog" the whole time.
If you came from either of my two blogs, both of which I do _not_ intend to link to. Many people on Github are intelligent, so they could easily track down my location.

The time currently is `17:37` and it is quite dark outside. The later it gets, the colder it gets, the darker it gets... It's just bad in general. Well, I guess you can't do anything to stop it, it's just going to get colder until it doesn't. Damn, some nice poetry there.

###Markdown + HTML...?
I haven't experimented with this yet, but I believe it MAY BE possible to combine Markdown and HTML. I might do it and post the results on the website in /logs/ (not implemented yet). If you do believe you can do it, please send me an email at: githubjli@gmail.com
