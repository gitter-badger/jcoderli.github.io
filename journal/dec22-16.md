# Hello again! It is currently 12:06

I'd like to thank the Academy, TheGenieOfTruth, my parents for supporting me through this mess of my dreams.
Why am I saying this? Well... I got Atom.io, Linux on a seperate window, AND learned how to commit to changes from my command line! I know, I know, any 5 year old can do this, BUT I did it on a Chromebook! But, the real catch is that I did that stoof in a short amount of time :D
So, basically, I'm happeh!

### News about HTML and Markdown

My test results have concluded that HTML overrides GFM, and you _cannot_ mix the two in a markdown file. I have yet to find out whether GFM and HTML can mix in an HTML file. Of course, I cannot do that now, but I will upload it later. You can find my results for the second test [here](https://jcoderli.github.io/logs/htmlandmdtest2). If you have anything you want to message me about, email me here: githubjli@gmail.com.

### Las Vegas COMING VERY SOON!

I'm going to Las Vegas with my family. Instead of posting on the /journal part, I will post on the /journal/vacations. I have yet to make a page for that, so expect it later!

I will be at the airport at 13:00.


# **All new updates will be in Las Vegas or will be about Las Vegas, so will be posted at jcoderli.github.io/journal/vacations/2016/las-vegas/day1**
